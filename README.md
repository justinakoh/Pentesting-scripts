# Readme
Repo containing a series of really basic scripts to help with the pentesting process. 

## List of Scripts and Descriptions:
- **cookie-checker.py**: script which checks whether two scripts are identical. Should ideally highlight and output the differences between the two strings in a nice format (not implemented yet). Created because cookies are really big and hard to manually check differences for.
